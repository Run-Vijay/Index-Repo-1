            <p>Hi, I'm Mohit! I am passionate about web development, creative problem-solving, and continuous learning. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I love building interactive and visually appealing websites. I enjoy exploring new technologies like React and Node.js, and I'm always eager to take on challenging projects that help me grow as a developer. In addition to coding, I have a keen interest in graphic design and UI/UX, which allows me to create user-friendly and engaging digital experiences. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I am dedicated to delivering high-quality results and constantly pushing the boundaries of my skills.</p>
